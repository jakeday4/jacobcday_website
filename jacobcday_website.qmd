## About Me

I am an associate professor of criminology at the [University of North Carolina Wilmington](https://uncw.edu/soccrm/). My current research and teaching has been focused primarily on criminological theory and replication and reproducibility within the social sciences. In the past, I have done work that centers on social capital, segregation, and race inequality in labor markets, particularly within the context of [college sports](https://workinprogress.oowsection.org/2016/03/09/racial-segregation-and-job-promotion-among-coaches-in-american-college-football/), as well as criminal and juvenile justice policy. I still dabble in research on labor markets and inequality, but it has become less central to my research and teaching over the past few years.
