    "text": "I am an associate professor of criminology at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. My current research and teaching focuses primarily on 1) criminological theory and 2) replication and reproducibility within the social sciences, with a specific focus on criminology. In the past, I have done work focused on social capital, segregation, and race inequality in labor markets, particularly within the context of college sports, as well as criminal and juvenile justice policy. Although I still have some recent and ongoing research related to labor markets and inequality, it has become less central to my research and teaching over the past few years."
