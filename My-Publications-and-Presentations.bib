	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Scholars examining the effects of social capital on racial inequality in coaching labor markets have focused primarily on differences in individual coaches' access to, quality of, and returns from their use of social connections (see for example Day and McDonald 2010; Sagas and Cunningham 2005).  The labor market context in which social capital operates has received less attention. Researchers have conceptualized coaching labor markets as occupational internal labor markets (OILMs) where movement is prevalent across firms within the same occupation and where high status incumbents control access to and mobility within the labor market (Smith 1983; Smith and Abbott 1983). In this paper I argue that these features of the college football coaching labor market make social capital particularly important for advancement. Analyzing data on connections among all full-time college football coaches in a major conference during the 2007 season I find that high status coaches have more ties to other coaches in the same conference, serve as intermediaries to more relationships, and have more racially homophilous connections than coaches in lower status jobs.},

The authors review the evidence base for the effectiveness of programs for girls in custody or under supervision by examining the evaluation evidence for nine gender-specific programs (which exclusively target girls) and six gender-non-specific programs (which target both girls and boys). Through this process, the authors summarize the evidence of effectiveness available to researchers and practitioners, identify barriers to determining what programs work for adjudicated girls, and make recommendations for building a solid evidence base on what works for adjudicated girls.},

The findings underscore the importance and complexity of the relationships between race, social capital, and occupational mobility.},

	abstract = {To better understand persistent race and gender inequality in the labor market, this article discusses the informal processes by which social connections provide individuals with access to information, influence, and status that help to further people’s careers. Because social networks are segregated by race and gender, access to these social capital resources tends to be greater for white men than for minorities and women. To illustrate this point, research on the invisible hand of social capital is presented. In short, high-level job openings are commonly filled with non-searchers – people who are not looking for new jobs – thanks to their receipt of unsolicited job leads. Recent studies find that this process operates more effectively for white men than for minorities and women, demonstrating how the invisible hand of social capital helps to perpetuate race and gender inequality. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings and directions for future research.},

Results from logistic regression models applied to data from a sample of 481 prisoners incarcerated in state correctional facilities across the United States provide mixed support for the theory. Coercive experiences within prison are associated with engagement in violent misconduct as well as defiant and institutionalized forms of inmate resistance. However, social support is not consistently related to either misconduct or resistance. Furthermore, results suggest that prison staff can inhibit these reactive behaviors by effectively reducing violence and promoting safety within prisons. These findings have important implications for the status of DCSST and for advancing popular explanations of inmate misconduct.},

The contingent effects of trauma, depression/anxiety, alcohol/drug abuse, anger/irritability, and somatic complaints are also examined.Results:Compared to traditional programming, gender responsive programming for youth in secure detention is associated with a lower risk of recidivism for girls with gender-sensitive risk factors but a higher risk of recidivism among girls who do not display these risk factors. Gender responsive programs are no more or less effective at reducing recidivism for boys, regardless of whether they display risk factors commonly associated with girls? delinquency and confinement.Conclusions:The results suggest that girls in secure detention require different approaches depending on their histories of trauma and associated mental and physical health issues. While girls who follow gendered pathways into detention benefit from the relational approach employed in gender responsive programs, girls without such issues benefit more from traditional reinforcement programming.},

	abstract = {To better understand the documented racial inequality in access to high status positions within the American labor market, this study investigates racial differences in job-level career patterns within the college football coaching profession. Using data on the career histories of 319 college football coaches from the 2009 season, this study examines whether black and white coaches have different job-level mobility patterns throughout their careers using optimal matching sequence analysis. Descriptive results identify five common career trajectories within the college football coaching profession that are distinguished by their relative levels of job mobility and stagnation, and the amount of time spent at the lower college and high school levels of competition before reaching the highest level of college football. Subsequent analyses indicate that white coaches are more likely to follow upward career trajectories while black coaches are more likely to get stuck in careers characterized by low-level positions. These racial differences are due, in part, to coaches’ experience as football athletes (i.e. position played). However, even given the same pre-career experience, racial differences emerge in the likelihood of traversing mobile or stagnant career pathways. The results point to particularistic processes operating to perpetuate racial inequality within the college football coaching profession similar to those that have been shown to operate in other high-status labor market contexts.},

	abstract = {This article presents two alternative methods to null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) for improving inferences from underpowered research designs. Post hoc design analysis (PHDA) assesses whether an NHST analysis generating null findings might otherwise have had sufficient power to detect effects of plausible magnitudes. Bayesian analysis with default priors offers advantages over NHST for assessing null findings and detecting signals in underpowered data. Both methods are illustrated by application to Pager and Quillian’s influential study on attitude-behavior correspondence. PHDA results suggest the original study lacked sufficient power to detect strong associations between employers’ attitudes and behaviors. Bayesian analysis confirms strong attitude–behavior associations cannot be ruled out given the data. Together, these results question a frequently cited conclusion about attitude–behavior incongruence in survey vignettes. Overall, the examples illustrate how these analytical tools can be useful for describing uncertainty surrounding estimates and for improving substantive and theoretical debates across sociology.},

Using nationally representative sampling frame, data were collected from 314 schools across the United States in 2009-2010. Results of OLS regression analyses show support for predictions from both the school climate literature and macro-level general strain theory. Specifically, racial heterogeneity, high amounts of pressure from schoolwork, poor peer-to-peer relationships, school-level negative emotions (e.g. proportion of students feeling low and feeling frustrated with their appearance) are associated with school-level traditional bullying victimization. Schools in which students spent more time on the computer were more likely to have instances of cyberbullying victimization. Also, negative family relationships was found to predict cyberbullying victimization, as well as the two negative emotions of feeling low and frustration. The study concludes with a discussion of limitations and directions for future research and provides critical suggestions regarding a popular bullying prevention program.},

Between-person (cross-sectional) portions of these models, which replicate patterns frequently documented in other social settings in a rarely studied cultural context, assess: (1) whether residents of disadvantaged (e.g., low SES urban) communities report more stress, and (2) whether individuals who experience more stress also report more depressive symptoms and higher criminality (i.e., criminal intent and behavior). Within-person (longitudinal) portions of these models, which eliminate time-stable sources of confounding in estimating stress-outcome associations, assess: (3) whether changes in stress levels across a two-year period are positively correlated as expected with changes in depression and criminality, and (4) whether these change correlations vary systematically across social locations. Regarding the latter, we explore whether positive stress-outcome change correlations are strongest (consistent with stress amplification hypothesis) or weakest (consistent with stress acclimation hypothesis) among residents of low-SES urban communities where chronic stress exposure is most common.},
