I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology and Criminology at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. Here is my [CV](Day_CV_2022-08-24.pdf).

You can find some of my course materials and blog entries at the [Reluctant Criminologists](https://reluctantcriminologists.com/), a collaborative website that I co-author with [Jon Brauer](https://jonbrauer.com/).
